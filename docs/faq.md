# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### ❓ I'm new to open source, how do I get started?

Welcome! Check out our [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for step-by-step guidance.  
You don’t need to be an expert — even fixing typos, improving docs, or giving feedback counts!

---

### ❓ How do I run the project locally?

See [usage.md](usage.md) for detailed setup instructions.  
In short:  
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
> Make sure you have **Node.js** installed before running the commands.

### ❓ What if I only know a little React?

That’s perfectly fine. There are issues for all skill levels, and we’ll tag beginner-friendly ones with `good first issue`.

Contributions aren’t just coding — design ideas, docs, and bug reports all matter.
