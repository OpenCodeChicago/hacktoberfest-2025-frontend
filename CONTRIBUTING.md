# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to **Open Code Chicago**!  
We welcome contributions of all skill levels.

---

## Before You Start
- Please read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- Check out the [Usage Guide](./docs/usage.md) to run the project locally
- Look at [open issues](https://github.com/OpenCodeChicago/hacktoberfest-2025-frontend/issues) to see where you can help
- Review our [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/OpenCodeChicago/projects/2) to see **available tasks**  
  - Comment on the task you’d like to work on so a maintainer can assign it to you  
  - This helps avoid duplicate work and keeps efforts coordinated 

---

## How to Contribute
1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Pick a task** from the [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/OpenCodeChicago/projects/2) or from [open issues](https://github.com/OpenCodeChicago/hacktoberfest-2025-frontend/issues)  
   - Comment to claim it before starting work 
3. **Create a branch** for your work (e.g. `feature/awesome-feature` or `fix/typo`)  
4. **Make your changes** and commit with clear, descriptive messages  
5. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** to the `main` branch  
   - Reference any related issues (e.g. `Closes #123`)  
   - Keep PRs small and focused — easier to review and merge  

---

## Guidelines
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages  
- Keep your PR focused on a single change  
- Follow code style (Prettier config is included in the project)
- Run `npm run lint` before pushing 
- Write clean, well-documented code  
- Add/update tests if relevant

## Recognition with All Contributors
We use the [All Contributors](https://allcontributors.org) bot to recognize and celebrate all types of contributions.  
After your Pull Request is merged, you can add yourself by commenting:

`@all-contributors please add <your-username> for <contribution-type>`

Contribution types include `code`, `doc`, `design`, `infra`, `ideas`, `maintenance`, and more (see the [emoji key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key)).  

The bot will then open a PR to **update** the **README automatically with your profile**.  

For detailed instructions, see the [All Contributors bot usage guide](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage).

## Issues
- Use issues to report bugs, request features, or ask questions  
- Before opening a new issue, check if it already exists  
- Apply labels when possible (`bug`, `enhancement`, `good first issue`)
